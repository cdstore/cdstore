DreamTeam CDStore project for CSI5380 Fall 2011
Project requirements: http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lpeyton/csi5380project.html

===== Building & Deploying CDStore on Windows (no Eclipse required - see below for developer instructions) =====

1. Tomcat
- Download & unzip tomcat (ex: http://apache.mirror.iweb.ca/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.22/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.22.zip )
[???]- set up SSL as per http://blog.frankel.ch/ssl-your-tomcat-7
- Set TOMCAT_HOME to the root of the tomcat server (ex: J:\work\apache-tomcat-7.0.22) (required since contains servlet libraries and will auto-deploy the jars/wars to the correct folder)

2. Ant
- Download & unzip ant (ex: http://apache.parentingamerica.com//ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.8.2-bin.zip )
- Add the ant 'bin' folder to PATH (ex: C:\Program Files\apache-ant-1.8.2\bin) so that you can run 'ant' from command line
- As required by ant, set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to your JDK (ex: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0)

3. MySQL
- Install mysql such that you can type 'mysql' at command line (if the installer didn't do it, ensure PATH contains "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin" or similar)
- Run 'mysql -u root -p' from command line (if first run, press enter for the password)
- Set the 'root' user password to 'asdasd' by entering the following two lines:
UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('asdasd') WHERE User='root';
flush privileges;
[???]- To insert the sample data, run the following from command line (using the correct path to the provided cdstore.sql):
mysql -D cdstore -u root < C:\cdstore.sql

4. Build & Deploy
- Use command line to browse to the 'DBAgent' folder and enter 'ant'
[???]- copy the CDStore.jar file from the 'CDStore\build' folder into '%TOMCAT_HOME%\lib'
- Use command line to browse to the 'CatalogService' folder and enter 'ant'
- Copy the CatalogService.war file from the 'CatalogService\build' folder into '%TOMCAT_HOME%\webapps'
- Use command line to browse to the 'OrderService' folder and enter 'ant'
- Copy the OrderService.war file from the 'OrderService\build' folder into '%TOMCAT_HOME%\webapps'
- Use command line to browse to the 'CDStore' folder and enter 'ant'
- Copy the CDStore.war file from the 'CDStore\build' folder into '%TOMCAT_HOME%\webapps'
[??? eventually to replace above steps]- Browse to the root of the provided 'cdstoreproject' folder and enter 'ant'. The build.xml file will do the following:
	- Build and deploy DBAgent.jar to Tomcat's libraries
	- Build and deploy CatalogService.war to Tomcat's webapps
	- Build and deploy OrderService.war to Tomcat's webapps
	- Build and deploy CDStore.war to Tomcat's webapps

5. Run
- Start Tomcat by running %TOMCAT_HOME%\bin\startup.bat
- Browse to https://localhost:8443/CDStore/


===== Notes for Developers =====
- Download & unzip Eclipse Indigo 3.7.1 (ex: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/indigo/SR1/eclipse-jee-indigo-SR1-win32.zip&url=http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/eclipse/technology/epp/downloads/release/indigo/SR1/eclipse-jee-indigo-SR1-win32.zip&mirror_id=492 )
- From the "Project" menu, make sure "Build Automatically" is unchecked
- File > Import > Existing Projects Into Workspace
- Provide the location of the cdstoreproject folder as the 'root directory' to import from (four projects should appear for import)

- For documentation use Visio 2010 - recall you can get it for free as a student via http://msdn06.e-academy.com/uoo_ite
	- And install the following Visio 2010 UML plugin: http://softwarestencils.com/uml/index.html#Visio2010
	- Also make sure to read the following basic usage instructions: http://softwarestencils.com/tips/index.html


===== Included Files =====

This assignment submission (cdstoreproject.zip) consists of:
- this document
- cdstore.sql
- cdstoreproject folder containing the source code and build scripts for the different components
[???] - manually deployable wars/jars? could provide instructions for just deploying where omit ant and build steps but need one folder to contain all final war/jar files
