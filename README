DreamTeam CDStore project for CSI5380 Fall 2011
Project requirements: http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lpeyton/csi5380project.html

===== Building & Deploying CDStore on Windows (no Eclipse required - see below for developer instructions) =====

1. Tomcat
- Download & unzip tomcat (ex: http://apache.mirror.iweb.ca/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.22/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.22.zip )
[??? skip for now]- set up SSL as per http://blog.frankel.ch/ssl-your-tomcat-7
- Set TOMCAT_HOME to the root of the tomcat server (ex: J:\work\apache-tomcat-7.0.22) (required since contains servlet libraries and will ideally auto-deploy the jars/wars to the correct folder)

2. Ant
- Download & unzip ant (ex: http://apache.parentingamerica.com//ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.8.2-bin.zip )
- Add the ant 'bin' folder to PATH (ex: C:\Program Files\apache-ant-1.8.2\bin) so that you can run 'ant' from command line
- As required by ant, set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to your JDK (ex: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0)

3. MySQL
- Install mysql such that you can type 'mysql' at command line (if the installer didn't do it, ensure PATH contains "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin" or similar)
- Run 'mysql -u root -p' from command line (if first run, press enter for the password)
- Set the 'root' user password to 'asdasd' by entering the following two lines:
UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('asdasd') WHERE User='root';
flush privileges;
[??? correct?]- To insert the sample data, run the following from command line (using the correct path to the provided cdstore.sql):
mysql -D cdstore -u root < C:\cdstore.sql

4. Build & Deploy
- Use command line to browse to the 'DBAgent' folder and enter 'ant'
- copy the CDStore.jar file from the 'CDStore\build' folder into '%TOMCAT_HOME%\lib'
- Use command line to browse to the 'CatalogService' folder and enter 'ant'
- Copy the CatalogService.war file from the 'CatalogService\build' folder into '%TOMCAT_HOME%\webapps'
- Use command line to browse to the 'OrderService' folder and enter 'ant'
- Copy the OrderService.war file from the 'OrderService\build' folder into '%TOMCAT_HOME%\webapps'
- Use command line to browse to the 'CDStore' folder and enter 'ant'
- Copy the CDStore.war file from the 'CDStore\build' folder into '%TOMCAT_HOME%\webapps'
[??? eventually to replace above steps]- Browse to the root of the provided 'cdstoreproject' folder and enter 'ant'. The build.xml file will do the following:
	- Build and deploy DBAgent.jar to Tomcat's libraries
	- Build and deploy CatalogService.war to Tomcat's webapps
	- Build and deploy OrderService.war to Tomcat's webapps
	- Build and deploy CDStore.war to Tomcat's webapps

5. Run
- Start Tomcat by running %TOMCAT_HOME%\bin\startup.bat
- Browse to https://localhost:8443/CDStore/


===== Notes for Developers =====
- Ensure you have TOMCAT_HOME, JAVA_HOME to v1.7, MySQL etc. set up as per instructions above
- Download & unzip Eclipse Indigo 3.7.1 (ex: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/indigo/SR1/eclipse-jee-indigo-SR1-win32.zip&url=http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/eclipse/technology/epp/downloads/release/indigo/SR1/eclipse-jee-indigo-SR1-win32.zip&mirror_id=492 )
- From the "Project" menu, make sure "Build Automatically" is unchecked since we will be using ant to build
- File > Import > Existing Projects Into Workspace
- Provide the location of the 'cdstoreproject' folder obtained from git as the 'root directory' to import from (four projects should appear for import)
- Do not select 'copy projects into workspace'; leave the projects in the folder that is synchronized with git so that you can commit your changes later
- Once imported, right click on build.xml from CDStore (for example) and select Run As > Ant Build to create CDStore.war in the 'antbuild' folder
- While ant should work fine, Eclipse will show errors in the project because it doesn't know where Tomcat's servlet libraries are, so add Tomcat to Elipse (Servers tab at the bottom > right click in white area > New > Server > Apache Tomcat v7 > Next > Browse... > Select your Tomcat folder > Finish)
- Don't worry about the XML warnings on build.xml
- run 'git status' in the 'cdstoreproject' folder; git should not list any files as having been modified by these build/setup activities

- For documentation use Visio 2010 - recall you can get it for free as a student via http://msdn06.e-academy.com/uoo_ite
	- And install the following Visio 2010 UML plugin: http://softwarestencils.com/uml/index.html#Visio2010
	- Also make sure to read the following basic usage instructions: http://softwarestencils.com/tips/index.html


===== Included Files =====

This assignment submission (cdstoreproject.zip) consists of:
- this document
- cdstore.sql
- cdstoreproject folder containing the source code and build scripts for the different components
[???] - manually deployable wars/jars? could provide instructions for just deploying where omit ant and build steps but need one folder to contain all final war/jar files
